# Review App

This is a CRUD app made in React which allows users to add, update and delete feedback.As a database I use a mock REST api with json-server.

Created together with Brad Traversy's course 'React Front To Back 2022' with my own personal changes.

Project is made with using React Hooks (UseState,useEffect,useContext), prop-types, React icons and up-to-date React routing.

# Usage

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run JSON-server on port :5000 and React on port :3000
